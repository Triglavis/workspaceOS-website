                <span class="highlight-brand">WorkspaceOS</span> watches your engineering workflow and eliminates the coordination tax. Through <span class="tooltip-trigger">screen-level awareness<span class="tooltip-content">Like having an AI that sees your entire screen. Works with legacy enterprise software, brand new SaaS tools, even websites without APIs.</span></span>, it sees when you push code, update tickets, or discuss blockers—then handles the cross-tool updates automatically. Your PR gets merged? Jira updates itself. Deploy hits production? Slack notifies the team with context. Debug session discovers root cause? Documentation writes itself. Every pattern you repeat becomes a permanent automation, cached locally for instant execution through <span class="tooltip-trigger">Pattern-First Computing<span class="tooltip-content">First time: learns the pattern. Forever after: executes directly. Your repeated workflows become permanent, cost-free automations.</span></span>. No APIs needed—works with any tool you can see on screen.
                <br><br>
                Our <span class="tooltip-trigger">Comprehensive Project Memory<span class="tooltip-content">Remembers that you always check logs after payment errors, always update Jira after pushing code, always notify Sarah when deploying. Acts on these patterns without being asked.</span></span> connects actions across time and context.
                <br><br>
                Stay in deep focus. Your AI partner handles everything else.
