# GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Repository Structure
- ✅ `index.html` - Main entry point exists
- ✅ `styles.css` - Stylesheet properly linked
- ✅ `script.js` - JavaScript properly linked
- ✅ `CNAME` - Contains: tryworkspaceos.com
- ✅ `.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow

## ✅ File Integrity
- ✅ All files are UTF-8/ASCII encoded
- ✅ No console.log statements in production
- ✅ All resource paths are relative (styles.css, script.js)
- ✅ External resources use HTTPS (Google Fonts)

## ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Triggers on push to main branch
- ✅ Has proper permissions (pages write, id-token write)
- ✅ Uses latest action versions (v4)
- ✅ Uploads entire repository as artifact

## ✅ DNS Configuration Required
- ✅ A records for @ pointing to GitHub Pages IPs
- ⚠️ CNAME record for www → triglavis.github.io (needs to be added in Cloudflare)

## 🔍 Potential Issues Resolved
1. **Removed `_config.yml`** - Was causing Jekyll build attempts
2. **Added `.nojekyll`** - Forces static file serving
3. **Removed `console.log`** - Cleaned production code
4. **CNAME file present** - Custom domain configured

## 📋 Final Deployment Steps
1. Push all changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. In GitHub repo settings (Settings → Pages):
   - Source: GitHub Actions ✅
   - Custom domain: tryworkspaceos.com ✅
   - Enforce HTTPS: Enable after DNS propagates

3. In Cloudflare:
   - Add CNAME: www → triglavis.github.io (DNS only, not proxied)

## 🎯 Expected Result
Site should be accessible at:
- https://tryworkspaceos.com
- https://www.tryworkspaceos.com (after CNAME added)

Build time: ~2-3 minutes after push
DNS propagation: 5 minutes to 24 hours
